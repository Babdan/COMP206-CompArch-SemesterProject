<h1>  COMP 206 - COMPUTER ARCHITECTURE SEMESTER PROJECT </h1>


The primary objective of this project is to create a unique Pong-like game using the MIPS assembly language. To cater to players with varying skill levels, the game will have an adjustable speed feature, allowing players to modify the speed of the ball movement or the delay between frames. Additionally, the game will include score multipliers, simple visual effects, and multiple visual themes to enhance the overall gaming experience and keep players engaged.
